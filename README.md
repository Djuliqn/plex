# Plex

Plex is a web application that processes a personal collection of movies and series of different users. The collections are SQLite files generated by another software product. Each user who logs into the system can upload his collection to Plex for processing. Users can browse their personal library, get information about movies and series that can be watched in Bulgarian language and point out whether missing Bulgarian audio or subtitles is an issue for them or not.

**Important note:** The project has yet to release its first major version, so stay tuned.
